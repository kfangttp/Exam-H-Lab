# Exam H-Lab

This is the project of automated test for these scenario <br>
<br>
a. Enter Shopee website, landing on home page with EN lang <br>
b. Search for keywords " baby toys " <br>
c. Website display search result as a list <br>
<br>
But Shopee website requires logging in. Upon logging in, an error 'Loading Issue' is encountered. So I test on Lazada website instead.
